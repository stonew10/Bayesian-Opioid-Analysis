# Bayesian-Opioid-Analysis
Various Bayesian multiple linear regression models are fit on the U.S. Opioid Epidemic from CDC's Wonder tool

The Opioid market size in the United States is valued at over 11 billions dollars with more than 150 million prescriptions
written every year since 2015--a rate that would be over 50 prescriptions per 100 people. In 2018, more than 40,000 Americans died 
from opioid overdose; the year before, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared a public health
emergency for the US Opioid Epidemic. 

In this analysis, data from CDC's Wonder tool is explored to see which demographics have been impacted the most by the 
opioid epidemic. We also propose the overall crude rate (mortality rate) can be modeled using a Bayesian multiple linear 
regression along with Bayesian model averaging, while comparing its predictive qualities to a regular frequentist multiple linear regression.
